## Concurrency

### What is concurrency?
In Go, concurrency refers to the ability of a program to handle **multiple tasks at the same time**.

**ðŸš¨ Important note:** concurrency **is not parallelism**, although it enables parallelism. If you have **only one processor**, your program can **still be concurrent**, but it cannot be parallel. On the other hand, a well-written concurrent program might **run** efficiently **in parallel** on a **multiprocessor**. ([Google I/O 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs) - Rob Pike)

### Key concepts of the concurrency

- Goroutines
- Channels
- WaitGroup, Mutex, Ticker
- Defer

#### Goroutines
A goroutine is **a lightweight thread** of execution in Go. It is managed by the Go runtime and allows you to **run functions or methods concurrently** with other goroutines, including the **main goroutine** (_which runs the main function_).

##### Key feature of goroutine
- Efficient and Lightweight
- Concurrency, Not Parallelism (We talked about it before.)
- Go Scheduler
  - The Go runtime uses a scheduler to manage goroutines. It multiplexes thousands (or even millions) of goroutines onto a small number of OS threads.
- Simple to Start
  - A goroutine is created by simply prefixing a function or method call with the go keyword.

##### Examples
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func proccess1() {
	fmt.Println("Process 1 has finished!")
}

func main() {

    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
      go proccess1()
    }
	
	fmt.Println("Main process has being started.")
	//time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Why we need this?
	fmt.Println("Main process has finished.")
}
```

**Important Note:** By default, Go doesn't wait to all its goroutines to finish. We can do this in several ways:
- Use time package and sleep until all process to be finished. (It is an awful method, but it works =). )
- Use channels ( We'll discuss earlier.)

#### Channels

Go channels are used for communication between goroutines. Channels allow goroutines to safely **share data**.


##### Key feature of channels
- Type-Specific
  - Each channel is associated with a specific data type. For example, a channel of type `chan int` can only transfer integers.
- Bidirectional or Directional
  - Channels can be used for **sending and receiving** data. However, they **can also be restricted** to only sending or only receiving.
- Blocking Behavior
  - Send: When you send data into a channel, the operation blocks until another goroutine reads the data.
  - Receive: When you read from a channel, the operation blocks until another goroutine sends data

##### Examples

```go
// Declares a channel for send and receive integer values
var ch chan int 
ch = make(chan int) // Initializes the channel


go func() {
    ch <- 42 // Sends value 42 into the channel
}()

val := <-ch // Receives value from the channel
fmt.Println(val) // Outputs: 42


```
**Buffered Channels**
A buffered channel allows you to specify a capacity, so sending only blocks when the buffer is full.

```go
ch := make(chan int, 2)
ch <- 1
ch <- 2

ch <- 3 // would block because the buffer is full
```

**Close a Channel**
You can close a channel to signal that no more values will be sent.
```go
close(ch)
```

**Restricting Channels**

- Send-Only Channels 
  - Declared with `chan <-` 
  - This channel can only send data
- Receive-Only Channels:
  - Declared with `<- chan` 
  - This channel can only receive data

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func sendData(ch chan<- int) {
    ch <- 42
}

func receiveData(ch <-chan int) {
    fmt.Println(<-ch)
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)

    go sendData(ch)
    receiveData(ch)
}
```


#### Advanced Topics

##### WaitGroup
A WaitGroup is a synchronization primitive provided by the `sync` package that helps you **manage** the **execution of multiple goroutines** and **wait for them to complete** before proceeding further in your code.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "sync"
  "time"
)

func main() {

  var wg sync.WaitGroup

  for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)
    go worker(i, &wg)
  }

  wg.Wait()
  fmt.Println("All workers completed")
}

func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
  defer wg.Done()
  fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)

  time.Sleep(time.Second)

  fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

```

**Key Points**

- Concurrency Management
  - WaitGroup helps coordinate multiple goroutines, ensuring all of them complete before proceeding.
- Thread-Safe
  - WaitGroup is safe to use across multiple goroutines because it is designed to handle concurrent access.
- Defer Usage (**Important**)
  - It is common practice to use defer wg.Done() in a goroutine to ensure the Done() call is made regardless of how the function exits.



##### Mutex

Mutex (short for "**mutual exclusion**") is a synchronization primitive used to ensure that **only one goroutine can access a shared resource** (such as a variable, map, or structure) at a time. This helps **prevent race conditions** and ensures data consistency when multiple goroutines access or modify shared data.

**Key concepts**

- Lock()
  - Acquires the lock
  - If another goroutine has already locked the mutex, the calling goroutine will block (wait) until the lock becomes available
- UnLock()
  - Releases the lock
  - If other goroutines are waiting for the lock, one of them will acquire it

**Example**
```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

const n = 10

var (
  counter int
  mutex   sync.Mutex
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go increment(&wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Final Counter:", counter)
}

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()

	mutex.Lock()
	counter++
	fmt.Println("Counter:", counter)
	mutex.Unlock()

}
```

**Important Notes:** 
- **Always use `Unlock()` in a defer statement right after acquiring the lock** with Lock(). This ensures the mutex is released even if the function exits due to an error or early return.
```go
mutex.Lock()
defer mutex.Unlock() // to ensure you always unlock the key
```
- **Avoid holding a lock for an extended period** to prevent blocking other goroutines
- Be **cautious of deadlocks**, which can occur if two or more goroutines wait indefinitely for each other to release locks


##### Ticker
Ticker is provided by the time package and is used to send periodic events on a channel at a specified interval. It is helpful when you want to perform an action repeatedly at fixed time intervals.

**How does it work?** 
- Ticker holds a **channel (C)** that **delivers the current time** at regular intervals defined by its duration. 
- You can **use it in a for loop** or a **select statement** to perform tasks periodically.

**Example**
```go
package main

import (
	"time"
	"fmt"
)

const seconds = 10

func main() {
	ticker := time.NewTicker(500 * time.Millisecond)
	stop := time.After(10 * time.Second)

	ch := make(chan string)

	for {
		select {
		case <-ticker.C:
			go sendData(ch)
		case msg := <-ch:
			receiveData(msg)
		case <-stop:
			ticker.Stop()
			fmt.Println("The counter has been stopped.")
			return
		}
	}
}

func sendData(data chan<- string) {
	data <- fmt.Sprintf("New Message - Time: %s", time.Now())
}

func receiveData(data string) {
	fmt.Println(data)
}

```

**Important Notes:** 
- **Always stop the ticker** using `Stop()` when you no longer need it to avoid resource leaks. 
- If you need to perform a one-time delayed operation instead of periodic ticks, consider using **time.After** or **time.Sleep** instead


#### Defer
`defer` is a keyword used to ensure that a function call is executed at the end of the enclosing function's execution, just before the function returns. Itâ€™s often used for tasks like cleaning up resources, closing files, unlocking mutexes, and handling other cleanup actions.

**Key points**
- Execution Order
  - Deferred calls are **executed in last in, first out (LIFO)** order. If multiple defer statements are used, the most recently deferred call is executed first
- Timing
  - Deferred calls are executed after the surrounding function finishes but before it returns to the caller.


**Examples**


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Start")

    defer fmt.Println("Deferred: 1")
    defer fmt.Println("Deferred: 2")

    fmt.Println("End")
}

// Output
// Start
// End
// Deferred: 2 - We've talked about the orders earlier
// Deferred: 1
```

**Important note**
Arguments to the deferred function are **evaluated immediately** when the defer statement is executed, not when the deferred function is called. (**Arguments Evaluation**)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	x := 10
	defer fmt.Println("Deferred x:", x) // x is evaluated immediately

	x = 20
	fmt.Println("Value of x:", x)
}

// Output
// Value of x: 20
// Deferred x: 10

```
